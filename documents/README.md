# Place for Webserver to Store Documents
In this folder the webserver searches for documents when the databases are built.
Further documents that are uploaded through the user-interface are stored in this folder for reference.
When documents are manually deleted in this folder the database needs to be rebuilt before querying it.
If not the application might still show them.
